 • Model Development & Validation: Established a perimenopausal visceral fat accumulation model and validated key behavioral, imaging (e.g., MRI-based fat quantification), and molecular (e.g., adipokine profiles, hypothalamic gene expression) indicators.
• Neural Circuit Mapping: Employed single-cell RNA sequencing to profile Kisspeptin neuron subpopulations and utilized retrograde/anterograde viral tracing to delineate their afferent inputs and efferent projections.
• Functional Manipulation: Applied chemogenetic (DREADDs) and electrophysiological techniques to modulate the activity of Kisspeptin neurons and their key downstream targets, assessing resultant effects on visceral fat deposition and metabolic parameters.
• Mechanistic Investigation: Utilized CUT&Tag chromatin profiling and estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists to elucidate the estrogen-mediated transcriptional regulation within Kisspeptin neurons and its role in circuit dysregulation.
• Significance: The study identified a central neuroendocrine pathway linking perimenopausal estrogen decline to visceral obesity, highlighting novel therapeutic targets.
